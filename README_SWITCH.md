# Make Week 2 the Default App

This pack keeps your existing files and switches the default entry to the Week 2 version so the new features appear at `/`.

## Apply
1. Unzip into your project folder:
   `C:\Users\gomez\OneDrive - University of Arizona Global Campus\Desktop\React Projects\INT499\Week1\streamlist-app`
2. Allow overwriting `index.html` and adding the new `src/` files.
3. Install and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm install react-router-dom react-icons
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open http://localhost:5173/ to see the Week 2 app.
