# Week 2 Merge (Original Structure Kept)

This pack keeps your original **main.jsx** and folder structure. It integrates Week 2 features directly into **src/App.jsx** and adds new components/pages. Your original `styles.css` is untouched; additional styles live in `styles_week2.css` imported by `App.jsx`.

## Steps
1. Unzip this into your project folder:
   `C:\Users\gomez\OneDrive - University of Arizona Global Campus\Desktop\React Projects\INT499\Week1\streamlist-app`
   Allow overwrite for **src/App.jsx** when prompted.
2. Install libraries:
   ```bash
   npm install react-router-dom react-icons
   ```
3. Run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Navigate through Home, Completed, All Items, About. Add/edit/delete/complete tasks; input clears; filter on All Items; data persists.

## Git Push
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Week 2 merge: routing, icons, CRUD, filter, persistence"
git push
```
