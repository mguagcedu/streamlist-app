# Week 2 Entry (Non-breaking)

This project keeps all your original files. A separate Week 2 demo entry was added to avoid overwriting anything.

## How to run the Week 2 page
1. Start dev server:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm install react-router-dom react-icons
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Open:
   - http://localhost:5173/week2.html  ← Week 2 demo (routing, icons, CRUD, filter)
   - http://localhost:5173/            ← Your original app

The Week 2 code lives under `src/week2/` and uses `src/main_week2.jsx` and `src/App_Week2.jsx`.
